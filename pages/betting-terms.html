Ninecasino.com offers the following types of bets:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
1. Single. A bet on the outcome for one particular market. Winnings from a single bet are
calculated as the product of a stake and the odds set for the selected outcome.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
2. Multiple. A bet on the outcomes for several independent markets. Losing one outcome means
losing the entire bet. The winning ratio of the bet is calculated by multiplying the winning
odds of all the events included in the bet.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
The following chains cannot be combined in multiple bets:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
1)Match - Match intervals - Shots on goal - Players
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>2)Corner intervals - Corners in the match</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
3)Yellow card intervals - Yellow cards in the match
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Ninecasino.com reserves the exclusive right to determine whether outcomes are interconnected.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
3. System. A complex of multiples of the same size, formed using a number of outcomes chosen
by the Customer.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Winnings for a system bet are calculated as the sum of the winnings for all multiples included
in the system bet. Winnings for each multiple within the system bet are calculated separately.
</p> <h3 class="Title Title--type-h3" data-v-04dff11c>BETTING RULES</h3> <p data-v-04dff11c>
1. All bets are accepted by the Betting Company based on the betting markets published on the
Ninecasino.com website on the date of the bet placement.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
2. Bets are accepted on regular time of the match (excluding overtime), unless otherwise
stated in the Ninecasino.com Sports rules.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
3. Only the amount confirmed and registered by the Company and not exceeding the current
balance on the Customer's account can be accepted as the stake.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
4. Bets are accepted before the start of the event, with the exception of bets accepted by the
Betting Company during the course of the event (Live bets). By placing a bet the Customer
confirms that they do not know the outcome of the event they are betting on. All claims
regarding the decisions of the Company are accepted by Ninecasino.com no later than five days
after the Customer has been notified about the final decision. A scanned copy of all the pages
of the Customer's ID (passport) used at registration must be attached to the claim.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
5. The date and time specified on the Website next to the event are the date and time at which
betting on the event stops and do not necessarily match the actual date and time of the start
of the event. The start time of the event, for bet settlement purposes, is the actual time
when the event started, confirmed by the official documents of the organisation conducting the
competition.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
6. The Company can make changes to the betting markets (in the odds, parameters of handicaps
and totals, restrictions on accumulators and the maximum stake, etc.) at any time. The terms
of the bets placed by the Customer before the amendments were made, remain unchanged.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
7. In the list of events, the home team appears first, if the location is not specified. All
the details provided in the header of a specific sport section are for information purposes
only. Possible errors in those details cannot be regarded as a reason for refunding of bets.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
8. In the case that important details relating to the team are not mentioned, such as the age
group (under 18/under 21/youth teams), gender (women), or the status of the team (reserve),
which effectively means that a different team is stated in the betting markets instead of the
declared one, all bets on the match will be refunded. In other cases, when team names are not
stated in full or there are grammatical mistakes in the betting markets, all bets shall stand.
If the gender of teams is not specified on the Ninecasino.com website, it is considered male.
In the case of a match between women's teams, the gender must be specified on the Website,
otherwise the bets on this match will be void.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
9. In the Ninecasino.com betting markets the home team is stated first (marked &quot;1&quot;), and the
away team is stated second (marked &quot;2&quot;). In other cases (tennis, table tennis, badminton
competitions, motorsports, boxing, chess matches, etc.) the numbering of the competitors is
arbitrary and venue details are for information purposes only.
 </p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
10. When betting on the statistics of a round/matchday (total goals, wins, losses, draws,
corners, yellow cards, etc.) only the matches listed in the betting markets on the Website
count. If bets on any match from a specific round/matchday are declared void, bets on all
markets related to that round/matchday are refunded and are excluded from accumulator and
system bets.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
11. In football and ice hockey it is forbidden to include more than one outcome on the &quot;HT-FT&quot;
and score-related markets per match in accumulators and systems.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
12. In cup events, bets on qualifying for the next round are offered.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
13. If a match venue is changed, bets shall stand, unless the match is moved to the away
team's ground, in which case bets shall be refunded and excluded from accumulator and system
bets. If both teams are from the same city, in the case of any change of venue, all bets shall
stand. For international events, in the case of a venue change, bets shall be refunded only if
the match is moved to the opponent country (the away team).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
14. If in the betting markets one or more match participants are stated with mistakes (with
the exception of translation errors), i.e. when a different team/player is stated, instead of
the actual one, all bets on this event shall be declared void and refunds shall be made (bets
will be paid out with odds of 1.00). Ninecasino.com reserves the right to determine which
category any given mistake pertains to.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
15. If the result of the match that is already finished was cancelled or changed by the
competition's governing body (and the changes were published in the official documents) later
than the cutoff point specified in Ninecasino.com Rules, irrespective of reasons, the
cancellation or change shall not be taken into account and bets shall be settled according to
the initial result. If match protocols available on the official websites contain
contradicting information, a decision shall be made based on the video recording. If the match
was abandoned and not finished within 25 hours after its start, bets shall be refunded and
excluded from accumulator and system bets. Bets on the outcomes which have been
unconditionally determined by the moment when the match was abandoned (e.g. first half result,
first goal and its time etc.) shall stand. There are exceptions in the betting terms for
certain sports competitions. More details can be found in the &quot;Sports&quot; section.

same player within one tournament (for example, &quot;to win the tournament&quot; and &quot;to win the
match&quot;) in accumulator and system bets, even if the outcomes are not directly related to each
other. If the Customer includes more than one bet of any type on the same match in an
accumulator or system, the accumulator or system will be void even if the computer program for

accounts in these cases, and ask them to send proof of identity. If two or more Customers
intend to use the same IP address, they must inform the Administration beforehand, explaining
the reasons for doing so and get the Administration's approval.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
38. Total type is &quot;Total of three outcomes&quot;, which can be applied to all sports according to
their specific rules. In Total of three outcomes, players must predict the number of goals,
pucks, points or games scored (thrown, earned or played) by teams or participants of the

over or under the goals/points specified in the total markets, or whether they will be exactly
as specified. If the outcome matches the markets offered by the Betting Operator under Total
of three outcomes, bets placed on over and under will be deemed lost and bets on equal to are
deemed to be won.
</p> <h3 class="Title Title--type-h3" data-v-04dff11c>LIVE BETTING</h3> <p data-v-04dff11c>
1. Live betting is offered by Ninecasino.com whereby customers place bets during a match or
other live event on outcomes which have not yet been determined. Bets that are received by the
Company for any reason after the respective result has been determined are considered invalid
and will be void (paid out at odds of 1).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
2. Odds on bets in Live mode are constantly changing according to events that unfold during a
match. Updates to information and results during a live event should be used as a guide only.
Intermediary results of an event that are displayed incorrectly do not constitute grounds for
bet cancellation.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
3. When betting on Live events, the Player can choose one of the following options to
determine whether their bets will be accepted if the odds change while placing a bet, or only
if the odds are increased: «Accept all changes in odds» or «Accept only higher odds».
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
4. Live bets are settled according to outcomes which are known by the end of the
event/competition. No subsequent changes affect the settlement of Live bets. Ninecasino.com
settles Live bets according to their own match statistics and data about the run of play
available to the Company. Unless specified otherwise, all bets on athletes who do not take
part in the competition are void in Live betting. If outcomes for certain markets become known
during the match, bets on such markets are settled, if possible, immediately, as soon as the
outcome becomes known.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
5. All bets for which the outcome is determined in Live mode will stand and will be settled
even if the tournament or event is interrupted. Examples: bets on who will score the next
goal, who will receive a yellow card, who will win a certain part of the match, and bets where
total «over» is reached.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
6. Claims regarding bets placed on a Live event must be lodged within 24 hours of the start of
the event.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>

settled will not be refunded. For outcomes that had not been determined at the time of
abandonment, payouts will be calculated at odds of 1.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
8. The Company reserves the right to correct obvious errors (even after the end of an event)
arising when odds are entered or payouts are calculated (e.g., mistakes in handicaps, totals,
odds), and to void respective bets (in this case payouts will be made with odds of 1).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
9. Bets placed in Live mode are considered invalid and will be voided (paid out at odds of 1)
in case of the following technical errors:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>- Obvious and technical errors</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
The company doesn't bear any responsibility for errors of input, transfer or settlement of
bets. In particular, Ninecasino.com reserves the right to correct obvious errors arising when
odds are entered and/or bets are settled (e.g., mistakes in odds values, team or event names),
or to void such bets even after the end of an event. In the case of obvious errors being
corrected, stakes are refunded. Common technical errors:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- Errors when odds are entered - when odds (or handicaps/totals, etc.) are displayed without a
separating character (point) or with an extra digit.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Example: odds are displayed as 18 instead of 1.8, 23 instead of 2, or 30 instead of 3, etc.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- «Mirror&quot; errors - when odds on players are displayed in reverse order. In this case the
match favourite (including the current favourite in a Live event) would be displayed with
higher odds than the current underdog.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Example: Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. Match winner. Odds are displayed as 4 1.2 instead of
1.2 4.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- Errors in display order - when all odds are specified correctly but the teams are displayed
in the wrong order (a variation of a &quot;mirror&quot; error).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Example: Displayed as &quot;Basketball. Unicaja-Barcelona. Match winner. 1.2 4&quot; instead of
&quot;Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. Match winner. 1.2 4&quot;.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
The following factors are indicators of obvious errors: large discrepancy in odds between
Ninecasino.com and other bookmakers; odds which are unrealistic considering the current
situation in the match.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Ninecasino.com alone has the right to determine whether an obvious or technical error has
taken place in each specific case.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- Ninecasino.com reserves the right to void bets that involve obvious errors including those
placed with odds that are clearly incorrect. The Customer will be informed immediately about
changes made to their account balance.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- The company reserves the right to void bets even after an event ends if these bets are won
as a result of a technical failure or obvious error.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- In cases where, due to technical problems, bets are placed when the Customer does not have
enough funds in their account, these bets are considered invalid.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
The user may be held accountable for any damage to the Company caused by intentionally taking
advantage of technical or administrative errors when depositing or receiving funds into their
account.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
10. Ninecasino.com is not responsible for the accuracy of results during Live events. For the

</p> <h3 class="Title Title--type-h3" data-v-04dff11c>MAIN MARKETS</h3> <p data-v-04dff11c>
1. The following bets can be placed on matches without handicap, if corresponding odds are
offered:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>- Home team to win - outcome displayed as 1.</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>- Draw - outcome displayed as X.</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>- Away team to win - outcome displayed as 2.</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- Home team to win or Draw (Home team not to lose) - outcome displayed as 1X. For this bet to
win, Team 1 must win or the match must be drawn.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- Home or away team to win (No draw) - outcome displayed as 12. For this bet to win, Team 1 or
Team 2 must win, i.e. the match must not be drawn.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- Away team to win or Draw (Away team not to lose) - outcome displayed as X2. For this bet to
win, Team 2 must win or the match must be drawn.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
2. The following handicap bets can be placed on the match winner:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Handicap is an advantage or disadvantage assigned to a team (player) by the Betting Company
and expressed in goals, points, sets, etc.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
The outcome of a handicap market is determined by adding the handicap value to the team's
(player's) result. If the resulting score represents a win for the selected team (player), the
handicap bet is deemed to be won. Winnings will be paid out based on the odds offered for the
bet. If, after adding the handicap value, the resulting score represents a win for the
opponent, the handicap bet is deemed to be lost. If the resulting score is a draw, the
winnings will be paid out with the odds of 1.00 (refund).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>For example:</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Team 1 Liverpool Handicap 1 (-1.5) 2.25 - Team 2 Manchester United 2 (+1.5) 1.9
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
1) Let's assume we are betting on Manchester United to win with a handicap. The handicap
assigned to Manchester United (Handicap 2) is equal to +1.5. For the +1.5 handicap bet to win,
Manchester United must not lose with a difference of more than 1 goal, as the +1.5 handicap
will be added to Manchester United's goals.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>The following outcomes are possible:</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
a) Manchester United wins, or the match ends in a draw, or Manchester United loses by 1 goal.
For example, the final score is 2:1. After the +1.5 handicap is added, the score becomes 2:2.5
to Manchester United (Liverpool's handicap is not taken into account, as we are betting on
Manchester United). The bet wins.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
b) Manchester United loses by more than 1 goal. For example, the final score is 2:0. After the
+1.5 handicap is added, the score becomes 2:1.5 to Liverpool. In this case +1.5 handicap bet
on Manchester United will be lost.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
2) Similarly, if we are betting on Liverpool to win with a handicap of (-1.5), the following
outcomes are possible:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
a) Liverpool wins by two or more goals, for example 3:0. After applying the (-1.5) handicap,
the score becomes 1.5:0 to Liverpool. The bet wins.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
b) Liverpool wins by 1 goal, Manchester United wins or the match ends in a draw. For example,
 the final score is 2:1. When the -1.5 handicap is applied, the score becomes 0.5:1 to
Manchester United. In this case bets on Liverpool with a handicap of (-1.5) are lost.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>3. Bets on Total (Over/Under).</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
These are bets on the total number of goals (points, games, etc.) scored (earned, played) by
teams or players. To win this bet, the Customer must predict whether the number of goals
(points, games etc) scored (earned, played etc.) will be above, below or equal to a specific
number. For bets on team totals (individual totals), only goals scored by one side count. If
the total number of goals (points) exactly matches the number specified by the Betting
Company, the winnings on &quot;over/under&quot; will be paid out at odds of 1.00.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>For example:</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
The total specified by the Bookmaker for a football match is 4, and bets are offered on the
total number of goals being over or under 4.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
If fewer than 4 goals are scored in the match (the final score is 0:0, 1:0, 0:1, 1:1 etc.),
bets on &quot;under 4&quot; will win, and bets on &quot;over 4&quot; will lose.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
If more than 4 goals are scored in the match (the final score is 4:1, 4:2, 3:2 etc.) bets on
&quot;under 4&quot; will lose and bets on &quot;over 4&quot; will win.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
If exactly 4 goals are scored in the match (the final score is 3:1, 4:0, 2:2, 1:3, 0:4) all
bets on &quot;over 4&quot; and &quot;under 4&quot; will be refunded.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
4. Total and handicap values, as well as the odds stated in the current list of markets, can
change after a bet has been placed. However, the terms of the bets which have already been
accepted will remain unchanged, except in cases where obvious or technical errors have
occurred.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
5. Correct score in match/set. You need to predict the correct final score of the match/set.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
6. HT/FT. In this bet you must predict the result at half-time and at the final whistle.
Outcomes within this market are displayed as W for &quot;Win&quot; and X for &quot;Draw&quot;. The result of the
first half is displayed first and the full match result is displayed second. It is forbidden
to add more than one HT/FT outcome into accumulators and systems.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
7. Bets on the winner of the competition and qualification for the next round of the
tournament. If a declared player fails to take part in the competition for any reason, bets on
that player will be refunded. If two or more participants take joint first place in the
competition, winnings on each of them will be paid out according to the following formula:
Odds = (IO-1)/N+1, where IO is the initial odds on the participant and N is the number of
winners.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
8. Bets on the statistics of a round or match day. If at least one match in a round of a
competition fails to take place, all bets on the statistics of that round will be refunded,
except for the bets on the results which have been unconditionally determined (for example,
&quot;will there be a 0:0 draw&quot;, etc.). The Betting Company reserves the right to void all bets on
the statistics of a round or match day, if any match is cancelled before the start of the
round and information about that appears in official sources.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
9. Bets on the total number of goals or points in the match being odd/even. The 0:0 score is
considered even.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
10. Bets on the time of an event in a match (for example, time of the first goal, time of the
first yellow card etc.). In this case the Customer must predict the specific time (the minute
of the match) that the event will take place. When determining the exact time for bet
settlement purposes, seconds are not included (for example, if the time of the first yellow
card is 44 min. 30 sec., it will be considered as the 45th minute when settling bets).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
11. To win from behind. The Customer must predict whether a team will win the match, having
trailed during the match.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
12. The Betting Company can also offer any number of other markets.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>

shall be void if the match failed to start and was postponed by more than 10 hours after the
time stated on Ninecasino.com;
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- tennis matches. Bets on tennis matches remain valid until the end of the tournament of which
those matches are part;
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
- athletics, skiing and mountain skiing competitions. Bets on these shall stand if an event is
postponed until later on the same date according to the time zone at the venue (date as stated

7. In the case of a refund a bet is regarded as &quot;won&quot; with odds of 1.00. If the Customer
placed a single bet, the stake is refunded in full. If the Customer placed an accumulator or
system bet, the overall odds of the bet will be changed accordingly (the refunded selection
will be settled at odds of 1.00, the odds for the other selections will remain unchanged, and
the overall odds will be calculated as normal for multiple bets, with one of the multipliers
being &quot;1&quot;).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Example:</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Multiple</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Event</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Outcome</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Odds</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Finland-Moldova</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Finland to win</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>1,55</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Malta-Croatia</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Croatia (-2)</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>1,7</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Bulgaria-England</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>England to win</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>1,5</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Total odds of the accumulator= 1,55*1,7*1,5 = 3,95</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
If Finland and England win their matches, and Croatia win with an advantage of two goals, this
accumulator will win. However, when calculating the overall odds of this accumulator, the odds
of 1.00 will be used instead of 1.7 (for Croatia handicap (-2)). So, the total odds of this
accumulator will be equal to 1.55 x 1 x 1.5=2.325.

Bets on the outcomes of sets which have not been played will also be void.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
In the event of an interrupted set, the set total is calculated according to the minimum total
number of points that could have been scored when play was stopped. The overall total for the
match is calculated by adding the total number of points scored in previous sets to the
minimum possible points total that could have been scored in sets that were not finished/not
played when play was stopped. Handicap bets on interrupted (uncompleted) set(s) and match
handicap bets are calculated in the same way.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Example:</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
A match is abandoned with a score of 15:10 in the 3rd set.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Team 1 forfeits.</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Team 1 - Team 2 1-1 (21-15, 17-21, 15-10).</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Minimum Match Total = 105 points (74 from sets already played+ 31 minimum total points that
could have been scored in the 3rd set) (21:15, 17:21, 21:10).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Minimum Individual Total of Team 1 (IT1) = 53.</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Minimum Individual Total of Team 2 (IT2) = 46.</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Based on this, bets on outcomes are settled as follows:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Match Bets:</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Match winner: &quot;Team 1 to win&quot; - loss; &quot;Team 2 to win&quot; - win.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Set betting - 2:0, 0:2 - loss, 2:1, 1:2- void (refund).
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Total: bets on totals with a value lower than 105 stand. Bets on totals with a value higher
than 105, will be void.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Individual Total (Team 1): bets on an &quot;IT1&quot; with a value lower than 53 will stand. Bets on an
&quot;IT1&quot; with a value higher than 53 will be void.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Individual Total (Team 2): bets on an &quot;IT2&quot; with a value lower than 46 will stand. Bets on an
&quot;IT2&quot; with a value higher than 46 will be void.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Sets Handicap: bets on the following handicaps ‘-1,5/+1,5', ‘+1,5/-1,5' will stand;
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Handicap: In this example, the maximum possible handicaps for the match are as follows:
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
a) 2-1 (21-15, 17-21, 21-10) - Team 1 winning by a margin of 13 points;
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
b) 1-2 (21-15, 17-21, 15-21)- Team 2 winning by a margin of 4 points.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Based on this, outcomes for handicaps ranging from ‘-12,5/+12,5' to ‘+3,5/-3,5' cannot be
determined and the relevant bets will be void. Other handicap bets, which do not fall within
this range, will stand.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>Bets on the interrupted 3rd set:</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Set winner bets: &quot;Team 1 to win&quot; - void; &quot;Team 2 to win&quot; - void.

stopped is 31. Bets on totals with a value lower than 31 will be valid. Bets on totals with a
value higher than 31 will be void.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>

In the event of an interrupted set, the set total is calculated according to the minimum total
number of points that could have been scored when play was stopped. The overall total for the
match is calculated by adding the total number of points scored in previous sets to the
minimum possible points total that could have been scored in sets that were not finished/not
played when play was stopped. Handicap bets on interrupted (uncompleted) set(s) and match
handicap bets are calculated in the same way.

</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Just like in real-life football matches, the result of a match is determined according to the
final score displayed on the scoreboard and is not affected by referees' mistakes regarding
goals or disputes.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Matches are modeled by artificial intelligence, developed by the independent international
company Sportradar. The outcome of an event depends on both the objective logical factors
which are well known to each customer (teams' tactics, current fitness, motivation for the
match according to the team's position in the tournament, personal relationships between the
teams, individual statistics) and on chance, which is determined by Sportradar's random number
generator.
</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
Each season lasts 141 minutes and is divided into 30 rounds (home games and away games). One
round consists of eight matches. The customer may switch between the eight matches in the
current round, or follow any single match of their choice. One match lasts 4 minutes 35
seconds.

</p> <p data-v-04dff11c>
The duration of each half is 45 minutes as in real-life football, however, the customer only
sees highlights lasting 1 minute 30 seconds. The half-time break lasts 10 seconds. At the end
of each game, there is a post-match period of 10 seconds. There is a 15-second post-matchday
period at the end, which concludes the game.
